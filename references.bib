  abstract = {This study conducts a systematic literature review to examine the implementation, challenges, and ongoing evolution of Scrum methodologies within Agile product development frameworks. Aimed at understanding how Scrum can be effectively tailored to meet the needs of diverse organizational contexts, especially in scenarios involving remote and distributed teams, the research also seeks to uncover the trajectory of Agile practices' continuous evolution. Employing a rigorous methodology, the review analyzed peer-reviewed articles and conference papers from key academic databases, including IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Scopus, published between 2013 and 2024. The selection was based on relevance to Scrum practices, empirical evidence, and theoretical contributions to the field of Agile development. Key insights from the study underscore the critical role of Scrum in enhancing collaboration, flexibility, and responsiveness in product development processes. Challenges identified include the necessity of overcoming organizational resistance and the importance of customizing Scrum practices to align with specific project and team dynamics. Notably, the research highlights Scrum's adaptability in supporting distributed teams through strategic communication and trust-building measures. Furthermore, the study points to the integration of Scrum with DevOps and its application beyond software development as indicators of its evolutionary potential within Agile methodologies. Finally, the study offers strategic recommendations for organizations adopting Scrum, emphasizing cultural adaptation, continuous training, and practice customization. It also suggests avenues for future research, particularly in exploring Scrum's integration with emerging technologies and broader industry applications, contributing valuable insights into enhancing Agile product development efficacy through Scrum methodologies.

The major application domains discussed in this review were product design and development, robotics, agriculture and construction systems, product-service and human-technology systems, medical systems and devices, military and aerospace systems, and data management, enterprise systems, and information technology systems. This exploration and accompanying discussion is useful for system designers, systems engineering educators, and other major stakeholders as it shows successful applications in a wide variety of non-software technology sectors and provides guidance for application in new areas.

  abstract = {Abstract             As industries mature, they rely more heavily on supply chain management (SCM) to ensure effective operations leading to greater levels of organisational performance. SCM has been widely covered in many industrial areas and, in line with other burgeoning sectors such as Tourism, an industry focus provides the opportunity to look in-depth at the context-based factors that affect SCM. Developments in digital distribution and rapid technological innovations have resulted in an increased focus on Digital Supply Chains (DSCs), which bring about significant changes to how consumers, customers, suppliers, and manufacturers interact, affecting supply chain design and processes. Through a systematic review of the Videogames Industry Supply Chain Management literature, which serves as a pertinent contextual example of a DSC, we look at how supply chains are affected by structural, market and technological change, such as increased platformisation, disintermediation and the proliferation of digital distribution. We distil these findings into a new research agenda, which identifies themes in line with extant DSC research, provides a series of relevant practice recommendations and identifies opportunities for future research.},

  abstract = {Agile methods are becoming increasingly popular in modern corporate strategies, which represents a paradigm change in project management techniques. The concept of pragmatic agility has become essential for enterprises to manage the complexities of ever-changing contexts. However, some organizations---especially small ones with limited resources---face unforeseen difficulties while implementing Agile-Scrum software development. In order to clarify the challenges small businesses, encounter throughout this adoption process, this study combines ideas from fifteen studies into a thorough and systematic analysis of the literature. The issues that have been discovered may be categorized into four primary areas: technology, people, process, and organization, and agile techniques. Organizations are able to anticipate obstacles by using a comprehensive understanding provided by the methodical examination and classification of situations. This proactive approach is essential to preventing unfavorable outcomes, as those seen in the past when implementation errors were made worse by culture problems, insufficient support from upper management, and waning consumer cooperation. This research provides small firms with a navigational aid by synthesizing lessons from the literature, enabling them to plan an Agile-Scrum adoption process that is more smoothly executed. Organizations may enhance their preparation, protect themselves from frequent traps, and ultimately maximize the transformative potential of Agile techniques in their developmental undertakings by adopting these insights.},

(A lifecycle covers all the stages of software from its inception with requirements definition through to fielding and maintenance.) System development lifecycle models have drawn heavily on software and so the two terms can be used interchangeably in terms of SDLC, especially since software development in this respect encompasses software systems development. Because the merits of selecting and using an SDLC vary according to the environment in which software is developed as well as its application, I discuss three broad categories for consideration when analyzing the relative merits of SDLC models. I consider the waterfall model before the other models because it has had a profound effect on software development, and has additionally influenced many SDLC models prevalent today. Thereafter, I consider some of the mainstream models and finish with a discussion of what the future could hold for SDLC models.},

Es el sucesor del juego arcade de 1983 Mario Bros. y el primero de la serie Super Mario. Tras un lanzamiento de prueba para la NES en EE. UU., se adapt{\'o} a los salones recreativos internacionales en la consola Nintendo Vs. System a principios de 1986. La versi{\'o}n para NES sali{\'o} a la venta en Norteam{\'e}rica ese mismo a{\~n}o y en las regiones PAL en 1987. Los jugadores controlan a Mario, o a su hermano Luigi en el modo multijugador, para explorar el Reino Champi{\~n}{\'o}n y rescatar a la Princesa Toadstool del Rey Koopa ---m{\'a}s tarde llamado Bowser---. Atraviesan fases de desplazamiento lateral evitando peligros como enemigos y pozos con la ayuda de potenciadores como el Super Champi{\~n}{\'o}n, la Flor de Fuego y la estrella. Fue dise{\~n}ado por Shigeru Miyamoto y Takashi Tezuka como <<una gran culminaci{\'o}n>> de los tres a{\~n}os que el equipo de Famicom dedic{\'o} a la mec{\'a}nica y programaci{\'o}n, bas{\'a}ndose en sus experiencias de trabajo en Devil World y en los t{\'i}tulos de desplazamiento lateral Excitebike y Kung Fu para avanzar en su labor previo en <<juegos atl{\'e}ticos>> de plataformas como Donkey Kong y Mario Bros. El dise{\~n}o del primer nivel, World 1-1, es un tutorial para la entrega de plataformas. Super Mario Bros. suele citarse como uno de los mejores videojuegos de todos los tiempos, y es especialmente admirado por la precisi{\'o}n de sus controles. Se ha reeditado en la mayor{\'i}a de las consolas Nintendo y es uno de los m{\'a}s vendidos de todos los tiempos, con m{\'a}s de 58 millones de copias vendidas en todo el mundo. Se considera, junto con la NES, uno de los factores clave de la reactivaci{\'o}n de la industria tras la crisis de 1983 y ayud{\'o} a popularizar el g{\'e}nero de los juegos de plataformas de desplazamiento lateral. La banda sonora de K{\=o}ji Kond{\=o} es una de las primeras y m{\'a}s populares, ya que convirti{\'o} la m{\'u}sica en una pieza central del dise{\~n}o y, desde entonces, se considera una de las mejores pista de sonido de todos los tiempos. Mario pas{\'o} a ocupar un lugar destacado en la cultura popular, y Super Mario Bros. inici{\'o} una franquicia multimedia que incluye una serie de t{\'i}tulos de larga duraci{\'o}n, una serie de televisi{\'o}n animada, un largometraje de anime japon{\'e}s, una cinta de acci{\'o}n real y otra de animaci{\'o}n.},

  abstract = {The comparative analysis of software development models, also called the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), is an everyday discourse among software engineers, reflecting the dynamic nature of the field. Within this realm, various software development methodologies, such as prototyping, spiral development, and Rapid Action Development, have been established and recognised for their unique approaches to software creation. In recent years, Agile methodologies have emerged as prominent contenders in software development, offering flexibility, adaptability, and efficiency in delivering high-quality software within designated timeframes. Among the array of Agile methodologies, including Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM), Scrum, Feature-Driven Development (FDD), Extreme Programming (XP), Kanban, Adaptive Software Development (ASD), Mendix, Lean, and Crystal, several have garnered significant attention in the software development community. Specifically, ASD, DSDM, XP, FDD, Kanban, and Scrum have emerged as prominent choices among Agile methods utilised by software developers. This study conducts a comprehensive examination and comparison of these six Agile software models, aiming to elucidate their functionalities, strengths, and weaknesses. The findings of this comparative analysis seek to provide valuable insights for software industries, enabling informed decision-making when selecting software development models for upcoming projects. By understanding each Agile methodology's nuanced differences and capabilities, software developers and industry stakeholders can align their project requirements with the most suitable software development approach, ultimately optimising project outcomes and software quality.},

  abstract = {A visual novel (VN) is a form of digital interactive fiction. Visual novels are often associated with the medium of video games, but are not always labeled as such themselves. They combine a textual narrative with static or animated illustrations and a varying degree of interactivity. Visual novels originated in and are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70\% of the PC game titles released in 2006. In Japanese, a distinction is often made between visual novels (NVL, from "novel"), which consist primarily of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (AVG or ADV, from "adventure"), which incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside Japan, as both visual novels and ADV-style adventure games are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels are rarely produced exclusively for dedicated video game consoles, but the more popular games have occasionally been ported from PC (or a hardware equivalent) to systems such as the Sega Saturn, Dreamcast, PlayStation Portable, or Xbox 360. The more famous visual novels are also often adapted into light novels, manga, or anime, and are sometimes succeeded or complemented by video games such as role-playing games or action games set in the same universe. The market for visual novels outside of East Asia is small, though a number of anime based on visual novels are popular among anime fans in the Western world; examples include Clannad, Danganronpa, Steins;Gate, and Fate/stay night.},

While technology offers numerous advantages, such as fostering interactive and innovative learning experiences, the shift to online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted some challenges, including a decline in students' motivation and engagement, exacerbated by distractions like video games. However, amidst these challenges, Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL) has emerged as a promising approach to engage students and enhance learning outcomes. This research aims to develop a basic mathematical game using the Unity game engine to enrich children's learning experiences. The educational game seeks to support educators in fostering active engagement among children, specifically in fundamental mathematics. The game is developed utilizing the Game Development Life Cycle (GDLC) methodology.},
